# 🧬 Quantum vs Classical SVM for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

This project compares the performance of a **Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM)** and a **Classical SVM** in diagnosing breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The goal is to explore how quantum machine learning models compare to traditional models in terms of accuracy, scalability, and practical usability.

## 📊 Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and early diagnosis significantly improves treatment outcomes. This project utilizes:
- A **Classical SVM** using scikit-learn.
- A **Quantum SVM (QSVM)** using Qiskit's machine learning modules.

We evaluate both models on their ability to correctly classify malignant and benign tumors.
